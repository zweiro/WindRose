This is an academic project developed in order to deepen the basics of Svelte and the D3 library. For this purpose we have chosen to create a prototype of a weather station dashboard which contains a graph of wind data.

The code base of the graph comes from the wonderful work of Jules Blom on Observable: https://observablehq.com/@julesblm/wind-rose


## How to test ?

Clone the repository:

with ssh...

```
git clone git@github.com:zweiro/WindRose.git
```

or with https...

```
git clone https://github.com/zweiro/WindRose.git
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
cd WindRose
npm install
```

Then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see our app running. Enjoy !
